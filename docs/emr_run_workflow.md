# AWS EMR — Running Code & Jupyter Workflow

---

# Overview

This guide explains how to:

- Connect to the EMR cluster  
- Set up JupyterHub  
- Run notebooks  
- Use S3 data in PySpark  

---

# PART 1 — CONNECT TO CLUSTER

## Mac

```
ssh -i ~/keys/MSBX5420.pem hadoop@ec2-52-32-236-168.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

---

## Windows

```
ssh -i C:\keys\MSBX5420.pem hadoop@ec2-52-32-236-168.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

---

# PART 2 — NAVIGATE TO TEAM DIRECTORY

```
cd /mnt1/msbx5420_teams/team_15
ls
```

---

# PART 3 — VERIFY S3 ACCESS

```
aws s3 ls s3://msbx5420-2026
aws s3 ls s3://msbx5420-2026/teams/team_15/
```

---

# PART 4 — CREATE JUPYTER USER (FIRST TIME ONLY)

```
sudo docker exec jupyterhub useradd -m -s /bin/bash -N {username}
sudo docker exec jupyterhub bash -c "echo {username}:{password} | chpasswd"
```

Then exit cluster:

```
exit
```

---

# PART 5 — CONNECT TO JUPYTER (PORT FORWARDING)

## Cluster 1

```
ssh -i ~/keys/MSBX5420.pem -N -L localhost:8080:localhost:9443 \
hadoop@ec2-52-32-236-168.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

---

## Cluster 2

```
ssh -i ~/keys/MSBX5420.pem -N -L localhost:8081:localhost:9443 \
hadoop@ec2-34-221-98-70.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

---

# PART 6 — OPEN JUPYTER

Go to:

- https://localhost:8080 (cluster 1)  
- https://localhost:8081 (cluster 2)  

If blocked:

- click “Advanced”  
- OR type: thisisunsafe  

Login with your username/password.

---

# PART 7 — RUN PYSPARK NOTEBOOK

## IMPORTANT

- Do NOT upload datasets into JupyterHub  
- Always read from S3  

---

## Example: Read data from S3

```
df = spark.read.csv(
    "s3://msbx5420-2026/teams/team_15/data/raw/credit_card_transactions.csv",
    header=True,
    schema=TRANSACTION_SCHEMA
)
```

---

## Select PySpark Kernel

- Choose **PySpark kernel**
- NOT Python 3

---

# PART 8 — STOP NOTEBOOK

In Jupyter:

- File → Close and Halt  

---

# PART 9 — DISCONNECT

In terminal:

```
CTRL + C   (or CMD + C)
```

---

# IMPORTANT RULES

- Do NOT upload full repo to S3  
- Only upload data  
- Do NOT upload data to JupyterHub  
- Always use S3 paths  
- Keep same username across clusters  

---

# WORKFLOW SUMMARY

1. Upload data → S3  
2. Connect → EMR  
3. Start → JupyterHub  
4. Run → PySpark notebooks  
5. Read/write → S3  

---

# FINAL NOTES

- Replace `{username}` and `{password}`
